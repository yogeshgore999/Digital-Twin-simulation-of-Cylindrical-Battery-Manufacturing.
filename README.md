# ðŸ”‹ Battery Supply Chain Simulation using Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation

This project simulates a lithium-ion cylindrical battery manufacturing supply chain using digital twin and CatenaX architecture. It was developed as part of a university coursework project focused on production line simulation, process analysis, and defect detection across each stage of battery manufacturingâ€”from slurry mixing to final product testing.
